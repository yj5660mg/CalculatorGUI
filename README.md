# CalculatorGUI
calculator

Java Swing GUI (Graphical User Interface) application, is what I used to create this Calculator.
To creating this project, I had some ideas I got online on how to create a functional calculator.
I got the idea to creating this specific calculator on the javacodegeek.com site (link is below). 
I learned to create an enum operation class, what an enum operation class does is handle different calculator 
operations such as addition, subtraction, division multiplication and percentages.
The basics of the calculator essentials. One bug using the number 1. 
When you handle any operations with the number 1 being your primary number. 
It would add error numbers each time you clicked number 1. 
A cool feature I wish I wouldâ€™ve added onto the calculator along with fixing that bug.
